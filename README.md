Cyberbullying Detection on Social Networks using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

Cyberbullying has become a major issue across social networking platforms, negatively impacting individuals’ mental health and online safety. This project aims to develop a Machine Learning-based system capable of automatically detecting cyberbullying content in social media text.

The system analyzes textual data, applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and classifies content as bullying or non-bullying to support safer online communities.

🎯 Objectives

Detect cyberbullying content in social media posts and comments

Apply NLP preprocessing techniques to clean and transform text data

Train and evaluate machine learning models for accurate classification

Provide real-time prediction capability through a web-based interface
